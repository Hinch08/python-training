#We  have arithmetic operators/categories of operators in python:
#-Operators are symbols that help us perform different functions.
#1.Arithmetic operators:
#-used for numeric operators e.g(+),(-),(/),(*),(%),(exponentional),(floor operators,divide and run down)

#2.Assignment operators:
#-basically,used to assign values.e.g:
#(=)->assign a value
#(+=)->add and assign,for example:
x = 10
y = 12
sum = x+y
print(sum)

a=10
a+=12
print(a)

x=30
y=40
div=x/y
print(div)

a=30
a/=40
print(a)
#(-=)->subtract and assign
#(/=)->divide and assign
#(*=)->multiply and assign

#3.comparison operators.
#-This basically compares values
#returns booleans
#(==)->This means equal to.
#(!=)->This means not equal to.
#(>)->This means greater than
#(<)->This means less than
#(>=)->This means greater than or equal to
#(<=)->This means less than or equal to
num1 = 100
num2 = 1000
print(num1!=num2)

#4.Logical operators.
#This is basically used to combine conditions.
#and -> returns true only if all conditions are true.
#or -> returns true if atleast one condition is true.
#not -> reverses the truth.
#output the following:
#report.pdf

#darkmode v2
#postgres
#music-the first one(1,2,3)
#copy user dictionary another variable or dictionary,using.copy
